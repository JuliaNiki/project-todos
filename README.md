# Project Todos

This project "To-do" app was made as a Week 14 project for Technigo bootcamp. The aim of this project was to start writing our own reducers and actions.
The goal was to be able to add tasks, list them and toggle whether a task was done or not.

## The problem

I really enjoyed building this project, but I think it has been the hardest project so far because we use some kind of these apps every day to store our to-dos and we have high expectations of what we would like to build. My goal was to be able to sort completed/uncompleted tasks and filter the categories, but it was much harder than I could imagine to work with reducers and I wasted quite lots of energy to think how to build it and trying different ways. 
But I am happy with the result I made, I tried to keep it simple and clean. I managed to meet red level requirements by adding the timestamp when the task was created, implemented complete all button and trained a lot with styled components.
I also added a date input with the help of date-picker package and created categories for tasks that it not mandatory to choose.
If I had more time, I would hopefully develop my idea with filtering tasks and categories.
Maybe I will come back to this in a while :)
